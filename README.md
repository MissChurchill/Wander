# Wander
A map app using location

The Wander app was an exercise that I completed following a tutorial from the Udacity Android Kotlin Developer Nanodgree program to learn how to implement using maps in an app.
Please note that an emulator with the Google PlayStore accessible is necessary in order to run this app.
